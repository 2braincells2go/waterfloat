JSQL Documentation
JSQL main purpose is to retrieve desired data with SQL style of input to query large JSON files (database) which solves so many problems of programmers.

JSQL style of sql follows certain rules where we can run javascript functions inside JSQL quires where it gives efficiency of processing the query on specified datasource. 

Consider the following json object as DATABASE where we can define table names inside that.

var data=
	{employee:
		[{"name":"shiva","company":"cognizant","salary":25000,"age":23},
		{"name":"sudhir","company":"cognizant","salary":30000,"age":23},
		{"name":"voona","company":"miracle","salary":20000,"age":22}
		]
	};

Now we will see how to use the library

var jsql = new JSQL(); // this creates JSQL object
jsql.setDataBase(data); // to set the data in json format as database
var res = jsql.query(“select * from company”);// this method pasre the sql stores the result in res variable


if u want to display the result in table pass the result ‘res’ variable to jsql.echoResult(res); to get resultant string in HTML table

Here are some some rules of writing JSQL style of sql
 You can use caps and small but everything will be taken in small except the column names
 You can multiple spaces in the query.
 Can use “*” or column names followed by “,” but should not give any spaces in columns section and column names should be exact what we define in Json Ojbect.
 After where condition followed by column name you can use any logical function or javscript string matching function or any condition that you can give in javacript.

Syntax : where <column-name><space><operatot or method with value>

Example: where company .match(‘co’)
		 Where salary >=25000

All these rules are only to increase the efficiency of code.
Here are some examples
Simple select statement :
select * from employee 

Run JSQL

Resulting 3 Record(s)

name company salary age
shiva cognizant 25000 23
sudhir cognizant 30000 23
voona miracle 20000 22

Simple select statement with column names (column names should be exact what we give in
Json object ):
select * from employee 

Run JSQL

Resulting 3 Record(s)

name company
shiva cognizant
sudhir cognizant
voona miracle

The where Clause :

Coluum name should followed by where and a space and then logical operator with value or
any javascript function which behaves like a condition.
Example if we want to use LIKE operator here we have to use .match(‘reg exp’) in place of
condition.

select name,company,salary from employee where salary >=25000

Run JSQL

Resulting 2 Record(s)
name company salary
shiva cognizant 25000
sudhir cognizant 30000


select * from employee where company .match('mi')
Run JSQL
Resulting 1 Records
name company salary age
voona miracle 20000 22
Order By:
select * from employee where company .match('mi') ORDERBY 3 DESC

Run JSQL

Resulting 3 Record(s)

name company salary age
sudhir cognizant 30000 23
shiva cognizant 25000 23
voona miracle 20000 22

select * from employee where company .match('mi') ORDERBY 3 asc

Run JSQL

Resulting 3 Record(s)

name company salary age
voona miracle 20000 22
shiva cognizant 25000 23
sudhir cognizant 30000 23

For better understanding see the example.html file and run these queries.
